## üîÑ Business Logic Flow

### Sale Process
1. **CREATE** - Sale created with PENDING status
2. **VALIDATE** - Check product availability and prices
3. **COMPLETE** - Stock automatically reduced, sale marked COMPLETED
4. **CANCEL** - If needed, stock restored, sale marked CANCELLED

### Stock Management
1. **ADJUSTMENT** - Record stock movement with reason
2. **VALIDATION** - Prevent negative stock (configurable)
3. **ALERTS** - Automatic low stock notifications
4. **AUDIT** - Full movement history tracking

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Database Models
- **Sales** - Main sale record with status and totals
- **SaleItems** - Individual products in each sale
- **StockMovements** - All stock changes with audit trail
- **Products** - Extended with current/min/max stock fields

### Service Layer
- **SalesService** - Business logic for sales operations
- **StockService** - Stock management and validation
- **Repository Layer** - Data access abstraction

### Validation
- JSON Schema validation for all endpoints
- Business rule validation in service layer
- Type safety with TypeScript

## üß™ Testing

Run the test script to verify endpoints:
```bash
node test-api.js
```

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## üîí Authentication

All sales and stock management endpoints require authentication. Include the JWT token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```
